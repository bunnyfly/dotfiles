Dotfiles by Chloe Adeline
=========================
My personal setup! Probably not useful to most, but you might find some useful stuff in here,
especially if you use Colemak and Vim!

Colemak and Vim!
----------------
I have intuitive and concise mappings to reconcile Colemak and Vim with traditional homerow arrows.
All my tools [less, tmux, etc] are configured consistently in this Vim style. I've been using this
since 2008 and haven't looked back!

The idea is to use `HNEI` as arrows – keeping the traditional Vim homerow style – and changing as
little else as possible. This means `JKL` are free to use and `NEI` need new keys.
- `k`/`K` is the new `n`/`N`.
- `s`/`S` is the new `i`/`I` ["inSert"].
- `j`/`J` is the new `e`/`E` ["Jump" to EOW].
- `l`/`L` skip to the beginning and end of lines. Much more intuitive than `^`/`$`.
- `Ctrl-L` joins lines, making `L` the veritable "Line" key.
- `r` replaces `i` as the "inneR" modifier [e.g. `diw` becomes `drw`].
- That's most of it! See .vimrc for a few other details...
