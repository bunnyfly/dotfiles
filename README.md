Dotfiles by Chloe Adeline
=========================
My personal setup! To install:
- Clone into `~/dotfiles`
- `./install_dotfiles.sh`
- Run `:BundleInstall` in Vim to install plugins.

Info
----
I use the Vim editor and Colemak keyboard layout. All my configs are influenced by this for very consistent keyboard control across all my tools.

How I reconcile Colemak with Vim: my preference is to keep the Vim homerow arrows in the same location, which means that `n`, `e`, & `i` replace `j`, `k`, & `l` as the direction arrows. `k` is in the Qwerty `n` spot, and thus repeats searches. I never use the `s`, and so it becomes the new "insert," or "start," which is my new mnemonic for it. And `l` becomes an incredily handy and intuitive BOL/EOL key!
