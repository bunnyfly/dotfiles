What is this "NERD tree"??

Check out this demo http://www.flickr.com/photos/30496122@N07/2862367534/sizes/o/

The NERD tree allows you to explore your filesystem and to open files and
directories. It presents the filesystem to you in the form of a tree which you
manipulate with the keyboard and/or mouse. It also allows you to perform
simple filesystem operations.

The following features and functionality are provided by the NERD tree:
    * Files and directories are displayed in a hierarchical tree structure
    * Different highlighting is provided for the following types of nodes:
        * files
        * directories
        * sym-links
        * windows .lnk files
        * read-only files
        * executable files
    * Many (customisable) mappings are provided to manipulate the tree:
        * Mappings to open/close/explore directory nodes
        * Mappings to open files in new/existing windows/tabs
        * Mappings to change the current root of the tree
        * Mappings to navigate around the tree
        * ...
    * Directories and files can be bookmarked.
    * Most NERD tree navigation can also be done with the mouse
    * Filtering of tree content (can be toggled at runtime)
        * custom file filters to prevent e.g. vim backup files being displayed
        * optional displaying of hidden files (. files)
        * files can be "turned off" so that only directories are displayed
    * A textual filesystem menu is provided which allows you to
      create/delete/move file and directory nodes as well as copy (for
      supported OSs)
    * The position and size of the NERD tree window can be customised
    * The order in which the nodes in the tree are listed can be customised.
    * A model of your filesystem is created/maintained as you explore it. This
      has several advantages:
        * All filesystem information is cached and is only re-read on demand
        * If you revisit a part of the tree that you left earlier in your
          session, the directory nodes will be opened/closed as you left them
    * The script remembers the cursor position and window position in the NERD
      tree so you can toggle it off (or just close the tree window) and then
      reopen it (with NERDTreeToggle) the NERD tree window will appear exactly
      as you left it
    * You can have a separate NERD tree for each tab, share trees across tabs,
      or a mix of both.
    * By default the script overrides the default file browser (netw), so if
      you :edit a directory a (slighly modified) NERD tree will appear in the
      current window
